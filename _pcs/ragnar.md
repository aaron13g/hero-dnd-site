Ragnar Bloodtusk is a half-orc fighter trained in both traditional Bloodtusk ring combat and organized urban boxing circuits. Before the fall of his tribe, he was widely known in regional fighting circles—ranked among the top competitors, respected for discipline and endurance rather than brutality.

He entered Falcrest’s festival ring seeking access to the diplomat himself. The advertised prize was coin and a private audience. Ragnar’s true goal was information regarding his missing tribe.

Whether he won or lost, the result exposed Falcrest’s nature. The spectacle was never about sport. It was about hierarchy and control.

Ragnar’s former ambition was singular: become the greatest boxer in the land.

After discovering Falcrest’s involvement in the fate of the Bloodtusk Clan, that goal changed. His new purpose is vengeance—tempered only by loyalty to the party, whom he now considers chosen family.

He values strength, survival, and earned respect. He struggles internally between his instinctive belief that weakness must be overcome individually and the monk-influenced philosophy that strength should protect peace.

If Falcrest is proven responsible for his tribe’s enslavement or destruction, Ragnar will not negotiate.

He will end him.
