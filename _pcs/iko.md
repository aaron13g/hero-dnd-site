A wild magic goliath sorcerer with cloud giant blood and a con artist's education, drifting from town to town running small grifts while quietly searching for the cambion who trained him — and got himself dragged to an extraplanar prison on a job that went spectacularly wrong.

## Notable Details
- Cloud's Jaunt ability — can blink short distances, leaves shimmer trails
- Wild magic surges are unpredictable and emotional; he has learned to perform them as part of the act
- Self-imposed rule: only cons those who can afford to lose it
- His greed actively sabotages his own goals and he is fully aware of it

## Party Role
Crowd control, deception, and improvisation. Naturally imposing physically but relies on charm and misdirection first. Wild magic surges are a liability and a feature depending on the session.

## Backstory (Public)
Traveling sorcerer from the highland Thedetua goliath clan. Manifested unusual magical ability at birth — lightning struck the peak three times. Left his clan at sixteen with a theatrical impresario who turned out to be a cambion running long cons across the lowlands. Spent three years as a highly effective magical grifter. A heist gone wrong cost him his partner and his operation. Now works alone.



## Bonds
- Ally: Vex Shadowgrin (extraplanar prison, location unknown)
- Rival: Unnamed pit fiend (double-crossed by Vex, considers Iko complicit)
- Oath: Find Vex — for the debt, for the treasure, and for reasons he won't fully admit
