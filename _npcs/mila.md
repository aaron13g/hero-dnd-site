Mila is a mysterious woman. She was first introduced to the party when they discovered Jacob dead in the third session. 
Mila's ties to the Iron Flagon trace back to her childhood. She was born in the (LOCATION NOT REVEALED TO PLAYERS). She became orphaned sometime in her adolescence.
Once her home was overrun by the (SECRET), she made her way to the city, which held more opportunities to survive.
While surviving on the streets of Neverwinter, she made friends with two other girls. The first was Liraleigh, another orphan who had been taken in by the Flagon family, and the second was Ava Flagon, daughter of the tavern’s original owners.

Ava's family took Mila in, and they grew up together. Ava’s parents, John and Whitney Flagon, died young, and the Iron Flagon nearly closed its doors. Lyrana Delmont purchased the tavern, keeping its name in honor of the family. 
More importantly, she chose to keep the girls together. Under Lyrana’s care, Mila, Liraleigh, and Ava grew up beneath the same roof—working the tavern floor, sharing rooms upstairs, and forming a bond that would define their early lives.
Mila and Liraleigh met Jacob and Rowan (now Captain Rowan), and a love polygon began.... eventually Mila left, (details unknown). Jacob left shortly after for a life as a vagabond, and Rowan did what Rowan does,
bury his head and work harder to avoid how he felt. Liraleigh was left alone... and she slowly lost her mind. (DETAILS TBD in page titled: Belladonna and the Wolf)

"Liraleigh and Mila were insperable. When Mila left, she took a piece of Lira with her."

Mila was found alive by the party when investigating the missing guards. She was unconscious in a cave, near the beast of the woods. The party saved her life, and brought her back.
She ran into Rowan again, and sparks flew, in a bad way. She is not against him, but they are not on speaking terms. 
After saying her goodbyes to Lira and Jacob at their grave, she took up refuge at the Flagon once more, but this time with a mission. Thaldrin stole her diary and this prompted the party to discover her truth.
She is a Harper and was in the woods investigating Cult Activity. 

Now she believes Lord Falcrest is at the center of it. She worked with the group to steal his diary.
