Captain Rowan Blackstone is the Neverwinter Guard Captain. He resides in the Citadel and has held the position for nearly a decade. At 32 years old, he began his tenure as one of the youngest captains Neverwinter has ever appointed.

He first contacted the players when they reached level 3, having established some notoriety. He requested their assistance in tracking down several lost guards in the Neverwinter Woods.

He later encountered them at Lord Dain Falcrest’s party, and again when they visited Thistlemane after stealing Falcrest’s diary.

Most recently, he contracted the party to descend into the sewers and eliminate whatever creatures were emerging from below, though he initially attempted to dissuade them from acting recklessly.

Rowan was once best friends with Jacob, the werewolf humanoid (now deceased). He was also deeply in love with Mila.
