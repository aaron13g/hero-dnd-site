Captain Rowan Blackstone is the Neverwinter guard captain. He resides in the Citadel. He has been captain for nearly a decade. He's 32 years old, and began his tenure as one of the youngest captains Neverwinter has ever had.
He has contacted the players on a number of occasions. His first outreach was when they had reached level 3, and having established some notoriety, he reached out to them to assist him in tracking down some of his lost guards out in the Neverwinter woods.
(TO ADD DETAILS ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE).
He then ran into them at Lord Dain Falcrest's party, and again when they went to visit Thistlemane after the players stole Falcrest's diary.
He most recently contracted them to go down into the sewers and slay any monsters that may be lurking there (after trying to convince the players otherwise).

Known Allies:
He was also known to be best friends with Jacob (Last Name Missing), the werewolf humanoid (now deceased). 
In addition, he was in love with Mila.
