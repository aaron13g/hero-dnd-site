Lord Dain Falcrest is a senior diplomat of the Lord’s Alliance operating out of the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter. He first entered the campaign in Session 3, when his seal appeared on a letter ordering the party’s capture. From that moment forward, he has functioned as a political antagonist whose power is rooted in influence rather than brute force.

Publicly, Falcrest is disciplined, articulate, and committed to civic stability. He speaks often of order, rebuilding, and the necessity of strength in a city that has already survived catastrophe. His rhetoric frequently references the Chasm and the illusion of safety. He believes stability is not natural; it must be enforced.

Privately, Falcrest operates in calculated self-interest. His journal entries reveal a philosophy centered on risk, leverage, and “staying in the game.” He believes chance exposes weakness, and that public consequence reshapes systems more effectively than private fear. He does not see himself as cruel, but as necessary. Demonstrations of power, including executions tied to territorial disputes, are framed in his writings as instruments of clarity rather than malice.

Falcrest maintained contact with an unnamed man who introduced him to a worldview centered on volatility, movement, and “Lady Luck.” This figure encouraged orchestrated public risk and appeared hostile to any ideology seeking to eliminate uncertainty from the world. The identity of this man remains unknown, but Falcrest’s writings suggest the relationship became increasingly tense and coercive.

He also became entangled with Zespira Proper, a tiefling scholar and organizer connected to the Cult of Karhnzun. Zespira advocates for certainty, control, and the containment of chaos magic—particularly near the Chasm. Through her and her followers, Falcrest facilitated mining operations and covert labor movements routed through tunnels beneath the Hall of Justice to the docks. Ciphered pages in his journal confirm:

• Municipal tunnels beneath the Hall remain operational
• Labor and materials were moved covertly through those tunnels
• A mining charter demanded excavation at the northern lip of the Chasm
• Deliveries were coordinated through the Moonstone Mask

These entries were encoded with a simple forward-shift cipher, indicating deliberate concealment but not deep cryptographic sophistication.

The party’s suspicions were first based on rumor, later reinforced by Mila, who revealed she had been sent by the Harpers to investigate him. Direct confirmation came during the invitation to the Night of Games at the Ruined Castle Never, where Falcrest was seen departing with cult members, including Zespira—the same tiefling who nearly killed the party in the Phandalin mine during Session 2.

Falcrest does not kneel to the Cult, but he uses it. He does not worship chaos, but he exploits volatility. His greatest fear, implied in later entries, is losing control of the “method”—risk itself. He believes power must remain in the hands of the one who orchestrates the game.

He remains alive. His full objective within Neverwinter is not yet resolved.
