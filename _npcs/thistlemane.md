Ereyndor Thistlemane is the Advisor to the Captain. He stays in the Guard Citadel, and can be found in his study adjacent to the Captain's Quarters. He is often puttering around with explosive materials, or reading some ancient lore.
He has said some crazy things to the players in the past, including alluding to an event some 47 years ago which may have caused the cursed tree to be cursed, or awakened some kind of evil.
He said to the players he had failed to become a lich, and lost his love in the process. 
While he often appears whimsical and carefree, there is a depth to him which comes out in tense moments.
