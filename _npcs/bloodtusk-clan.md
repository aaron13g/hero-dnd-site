The Bloodtusk Clan was a disciplined half-orc war-tribe that controlled key trade corridors north of Neverwinter near territory adjacent to the Chasm. Though labeled “raiders” by city officials, the clan operated under a strict internal code emphasizing strength, loyalty, and earned leadership.

Conflict began when Lord Dain Falcrest sought access to their ancestral lands for “stabilization” and mining efforts near the Chasm. The Bloodtusks refused relocation.

Falcrest responded with political framing, public execution of a negotiator, and a coordinated enforcement action. Several clan members were killed. Others were taken through underground routes beneath the Hall of Justice and redirected into forced labor connected to cult-aligned mining operations.

The clan is now scattered. Some members are presumed dead. Others may still be alive.

The Bloodtusk ceremonial boxing ring tradition survives through Ragnar.
